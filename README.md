Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning web application that predicts the estimated price of a house in Bangalore based on user inputs such as area (sqft), number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and location.

The system uses a Linear Regression model trained on real-world Bangalore housing data to make predictions. The backend is built using Flask (Python), while the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a clean and interactive user interface.
